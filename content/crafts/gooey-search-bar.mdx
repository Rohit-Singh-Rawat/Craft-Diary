# Gooey Search Bar

A visually striking search bar component with smooth gooey morphing animations that create a fluid, playful user experience. Features expandable search interface, SVG filter effects for the gooey appearance, and smooth animations powered by Framer Motion.

## Craft Story

I saw this gooey search bar effect somewhere online and thought it looked really unique. The way it morphs and flows when you interact with it was unlike anything I'd seen in standard component libraries.

I wanted to understand how that gooey effect worked, so I started experimenting with SVG filters. The key was learning about `feGaussianBlur` and `feColorMatrix` filters that create that liquid, morphing appearance. Once I figured out the filter combination, I built the component with smooth expandable animations and integrated it all together.

<DependencySection
	dependencies={[
		{
			name: 'motion',
			href: 'https://motion.dev/',
		},
		{
			name: 'lucide-react',
			href: 'https://lucide.dev/',
		},
	]}
/>

## How to Use

<CodeBlock
	code={`import { GooeySearchBar } from '@/craft/components/gooey-search-bar';
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
	const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');

	const handleSearch = (query: string) => {
		setSearchQuery(query);
		// Perform search logic
	};

	return (
		<GooeySearchBar
			placeholder='Search...'
			onSearch={handleSearch}
		/>
	);
}`}
	language='tsx'
/>
