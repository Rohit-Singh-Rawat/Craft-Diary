# Hexagonal Background

A customizable hexagonal pattern background component built with SVG paths. Features gradient colors, radial fade effects, and seamless tiling. Perfect for adding subtle geometric texture to any design.

## Craft Story

I kept seeing circle, dot, and square pattern backgrounds everywhere online, but never a hexagonal one. I got curious about how these SVG-based backgrounds worked, so I started experimenting and learning the fundamentals.

The tricky part was figuring out the optimal hexagonal pattern. If you use complete hexagons, they overlap in certain places, so I had to find the right pattern that tiles seamlessly. After some trial and error, I figured out the exact arrangement that works perfectly.

Then I had to learn how to draw SVG lines using paths. Once I understood the path syntax and how to calculate the coordinates for the hexagonal grid, I built the pattern using SVG and made it tile seamlessly across any container.

## How to Use

<CodeBlock
	code={`import HexagonBackground from '@/craft/components/hexagonal-background';

export default function Example() {
	return (
		<div className='relative h-screen w-full'>
			<HexagonBackground
				color='#5271ff'
				cellSize='60px'
				strokeWidth='2'
				className='absolute inset-0'
				fade={true}
				fadePercentage={30}
				opacity={0.3}
			/>
			<div className='relative flex h-full items-center justify-center'>
				<h1 className='text-6xl font-bold'>Your Content</h1>
			</div>
		</div>
	);
}`}
	language='tsx'
/>
